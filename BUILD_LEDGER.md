# Build Ledger

| Field | Current value |
|---|---|
| Current stage | Between gates — Task 2 accepted; Task 3 packet next |
| Active task | None; Task 2 archived after acceptance |
| Working branch | `agent/task-02-bundex` |
| Entry criteria met | Yes for Task 3 packet creation after PR #6 merges |
| Product code authorized | No between tasks; Task 3 requires its own active packet |
| Live API authorized | No |
| Automated tests | Task 2 gate head passed locked restore, clean dependency audit, Release build, and 94/94 Windows tests |
| Manual gate | Task 2 passed exact-tree, 49-path scope, write-authority, recovery/cancellation, root-isolation, and forbidden-surface review |
| Accepted `main` baseline | `29d0a24e05b58f8ef053c4ebe0b6cfeea7b1ea99` — Task 1 neutral skeleton accepted and merged |
| Known limitations | Task 2 has no Vault, restore, repair, journal rotation, migration, production opener, or app wiring; Windows CI remains the execution oracle |
| Deferred temptations | Task 3 Vault/Repairs/maintenance authority and all later capture/API/conversation/personality work |
| Approval | Task 2 passed on 2026-08-10; acceptance records and PR #6 may merge before Task 3 becomes active |

## Gate history

### Task 0 — Architecture proposal

- Builder SHA reviewed: `9a51231aa8d76a399ef43ae4a8bfc5cdbd1195b3`
- Foreman approval review: `4892489052`
- Merge: PR #1 squash-merged to `main` as `58bbdf9915659b3887e311f7b9cdf819cc39fc13`.
- Result: passed as a documentation checkpoint.

### Historical Task 1 — Claude checkpoint

- Work reached closed PR #3 at head `da4797e1a3df2c6f0ddaaa0248098fd40f656121`.
- The implementation checkpoint and its passing tests were not merged.
- On 2026-08-09 the user withdrew authorization for the Claude–ChatGPT collaborative workflow and requested a complete approach reset.
- The task is preserved at `tasks/paused/task-01-skeleton.md`.
- Result: paused and superseded; not accepted.

### Task 1 — Direct neutral skeleton adoption

- Candidate: draft PR #5 at reviewed head `6c50b9d73607dcd70a4e0b931f0b8bceaffe59da`, exact tree `92ab14ced552624fb41b07170d35b2365ecf0565`.
- Scope: 65 allowlisted paths — 60 adopted product/build/test files, four control records, and the Boss-authorized Roadmap Stage 1 correction.
- Review: current-base diff whitespace, one-active-task state, changed-path allowlist, exact local/remote tree equality, lifecycle and process boundaries, test-mode confinement, and forbidden Task 2+ surfaces all passed.
- CI: run `31354524133`, job `93351605021`; locked restore passed, Release build passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors, and 60/60 tests passed (Runtime 26, Presentation 19, synthetic Capture 11, real WPF integration 4).
- D1: the Boss explicitly approved keeping Task 1 neutral and moving durable journal/checkpoint work to Task 2; only the stale Stage 1 roadmap wording was amended.
- Result: passed; acceptance records may be published and PR #5 merged before Task 2 becomes active.

### Task 2 — Append-only memory and journal

- Candidate: draft PR #6 at reviewed gate head `056dedceb120e48c01b9c71d9a1f2d31ad207a5d`, exact tree `ab010b6f5a0d17ec23f84ef0252332143421e427`; implementation head `f3e11acb08a2056f0fe557b4517383a14471227c`.
- Scope: 49 allowlisted paths — one neutral memory source project, one synthetic test project, solution/CI integration, bounded control records, and the Boss-approved Roadmap Stage 2 split.
- Review: current-base whitespace, one-active-task state, changed-path allowlist, exact local/remote tree equality, public write authority, journal → SQLite → checkpoint ordering, cancellation fence, replay/idempotency, unresolved-tail handling, root isolation, and forbidden later-stage surfaces all passed.
- Dependencies: both locks resolve all SQLitePCLRaw components to 2.1.12; the permanent direct/transitive vulnerability audit reports all 11 projects and no vulnerable entries.
- CI: run `31360021794`, job `93366932942`; locked restore and audit passed, Release build passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors, and 94/94 tests passed (Runtime 26, Presentation 19, synthetic Capture 11, real WPF integration 4, Memory/Journal 34).
- Personal Round Judgments J1–J8 record the tree-identical transport base, dependency pin, canonical envelope, fixed roots, pre-durability frame bound, checkpoint/store cross-check, duplicate-key rejection, and unresolved-live-tail recovery fence.
- Result: passed; acceptance records may be published and PR #6 merged before Task 3 becomes active.

### R0 — Direct-build re-entry and continuity alignment

- Candidate: PR #4, reviewed head `99b48124894d431060952ecaecb83900af7f0106`, exact tree `bfb3bcefe16f41535f8043a199a368f84f7cf4c3`.
- Scope: 11 documentation/control files, 371 additions, 123 deletions; no product, test, dependency, build, or CI file.
- Verification: diff whitespace, one-active-task, scope allowlist, stale-authority/awakening contradiction search, and exact local/remote tree equality all passed.
- CI: no checks configured or required for this documentation-only gate.
- Result: passed; direct Paw Gate workflow and final-only one-time Companion Awakening boundary accepted.

## Official Bnuy Backpedal™

Historical stop record from 2026-08-09; superseded by the direct-build authorization below:

- Hourly foreman monitoring was paused and remains disabled.
- Builder/foreman automation and task advancement stopped.
- Existing documents, branches, commits, and tests were retained as reversible references.
- The user later approved the new direct approach and R0 active packet on 2026-08-10.

## Direct-build resumption authorization

- On 2026-08-10 the user approved a direct Codex-and-Prince workflow with no Claude collaboration and no hourly monitoring.
- Work may advance autonomously one active task at a time after every Paw Gate passes, through all mock/replay construction that does not require real credentials or paid/live API access.
- Prince's Personal Round Judgment may resolve routine, reversible in-scope choices; material decisions are logged for later user review.
- Architecture, privacy, identity/authority conflicts, invariant changes, destructive actions, production-data access, and real API credentials remain explicit stop conditions.
- The preserved Task 1 checkpoint is not silently accepted. It receives a separate adoption branch, current-base diff review, and fresh required verification.

## Continuity decision — one-time Companion awakening

- Builder Prince remains resettable through neutral-core construction, full personality installation, final presentation, launch-readiness validation, and refinement.
- Companion Prince replaces Builder Prince exactly once only after every launch-required gate passes.
- The production BunDex starts clean. No construction memory, test conversation, staged opinion, or synthetic artifact transfers.
- Once awakened, Companion Prince is singular and persistent across all later updates, repairs, migrations, provider/model changes, and hotfixes.

## Ledger rules

- At most one stage may be in progress.
- No work occurs while there is no active task.
- Existing paused work is not authorization to resume.
- Later-stage ideas remain deferred until explicitly replanned.
- Each material Personal Round Judgment is recorded with rationale and reversibility.
